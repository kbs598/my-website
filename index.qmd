::: {#hero-heading}
Welcome! I am just trying to make the world a better place, or at least not make it worse. I enjoy learning new things and I want to pass on what I have learned.

Some things I love are my family, my cats, bird watching, lemon-flavored desserts, and science fiction books. I am currently the Associate Director of Institutional Research and Reporting at Furman University and a mom of three.
